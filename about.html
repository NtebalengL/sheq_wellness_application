      <h1>About SHEQ+</h1>
      <p class="lead">SHEQ+ is a free platform built to support children and women across South Africa with safety resources, anonymous reporting and up-to-date guidance.</p>

      <h2>Why we built SHEQ+</h2>
      <p>Teenage pregnancy and gender-based violence remain critical issues in South Africa. Contributing factors include poverty, limited access to sexual education, social norms, and insufficient local support services. SHEQ+ aims to reduce harm by providing an accessible place to report, learn, and get directed to help.</p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow anonymous incident reporting that notifies administrators</li>
        <li>Provide AI-powered, up-to-date guidance on safety and health</li>
        <li>Offer a directory of helplines and local resources</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">Sources included in our FAQ section are taken from reputable organisations such as UNICEF, WHO, and South African government reports.</p>
